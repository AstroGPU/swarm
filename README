README for Swarm-NG
===================
Swarm-NG Development Team
v0.1, April 2010: Initial release + 
Swarm-NG v0.1 (c) Swarm-NG Development Team 2010

Introduction
------------

.What is Swarm-NG?
Swarm-NG is a collection of code which to help scientists and engineers harness the power of GPUs.
In the early releases, Swarm-NG will focus on the integration of an ensemble of N-body systems evolving under Newtonian gravity.
There are existing libraries to perform the force calculation for large-N systems on GPUs.  
Swarm-NG does not replicate these, but rather focuses on integrating an ensemble of many systems where N is small. 
This is of partiular interest for astronomers who study the chaotic evolution of planetary systems.
In the long term, we hope Swarm-NG will allow for the efficient parallel integration of user-defined systems of ordinary differential equations.  

.What is included in {revdate} release of Swarm-NG {revnumber}?
This initial release contains GPU-based integrators for few-body systems, along with a draft of the public interface for setting initial conditions, calling the GPU-based integration algorithms and accessing the output data.  Small example programs are provided to demonstrate functionality and how to program with Swarm-NG.  

.Quick Start Tips
Read link:doc/build_system.html for how to build the library and example programs. + 
Read link:doc/for_deveopers.html for an overview of how to write your own programs which build on Swarm-NG functionality.


Buliding the Swarm-NG Libraries and Demo Programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.What hardware & software is required to build & run Swarm-NG?
* Hardware
** Linux-based workstation (certain kernel versions?)
** nVidia GPU with G80 or G92 chip (we intend to support Fermi in near future)
* Software
** CUDA v2.3 and/or v3.0 
** g++ v?.? (later versions likely to work as well)
** Boost++ v?.? (later versions likely to work as well)
** Anything else?

.How do I build Swarm-NG for Linux? [Mario]
Run `make`.  Users can specify the paths to compiler, libaries, and include files, as well as compiler flags in the file ''Makefile.user''.  

.How do I build Swarm-NG for Windows? [Young In]
While we do not intend to support Swarm-NG for Windows, we can pass along some of the following tips.

.How do I test Swarm-NG? [Mario]
`make test`

Demo Programs [authors of each demo code]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Commands to run demo codes
First, build the tutorials and demos with `make`.  Then, you can run the following demos from the tutorial.

- swarm_tutorial_cpu:  run `bin/swarm_tutorial_cpu`
- swarm_tutorial_gpu:  run `bin/swarm_tutorial_gpu`
- swarm_tutorial_compare:  run `bin/swarm_tutorial_compare`
- swarm_tutorial_montecarlo:  change into the run sub-directory and run `../bin/swarm_tutorial_montecarlo integrator-tutorial_montecarlo.cfg`
The behavior of this tutorial can be easily adjusted by changing the configuration file.  See the section below on xref:<DemoOptions>[Demo Options] for a list of required/valid parameters.

[[DemoOptions]]
.Demo Program Features/Options [authors of each demo program]

- Parameters for swarm_tutorial_montecarlo include:
** integrator: Specifies which integration algorithm will be used
** runon: Must be "cpu" or "gpu".  In v0.1, this must match the type of integrator specified by "integrator"
** dT: Specifies the duration of the integration
** h: Specifies the timestep of fixed timestep algorithms (e.g., hermite, rk4)
** Complete list

- Parameters for swarm include:

** runon: Must be "cpu" or "gpu".  In v0.1, this must match the type of integrator specified by "integrator"
** dT: Specifies the duration of the integration
** h: Specifies the timestep of fixed timestep algorithms (e.g., hermite, rk4)

.Known Limitations and/or Bugs [Young In]

- Limited to N-body systems with 3-10 bodies
- Must be many more!

.Overview of file contents [Young In]

.Where can I find additional documentation?
There is additional documentation for various componets of Swarm-NG in the docs subdirectory.
As the library interface solidifies, we anticipate providing additional documention in future releases and/or at the http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~eford/code/swarm/[Swarm-NG Website]

.What should I do if I think I found a compile-time bug?
- Please first check that you can successfully run `make test`.  If this fails, then please double check that you have the required drivers, libraries installed and paths set correctly.  You may need to create a Makefile.user to specify the path to your compilers, libraries, include files.  You may also need to specify the path to your cuda libraries via LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
- Please identify the minimal ammount of code that produces the compiler error.
- Contact Swarm-NG developers via the mailto:swarm-ng@googlegroups.com['Swarm-NG mailing list']

.What should I do if I think I found a run-time bug?
Unfortunately, GPUs can sometime get stuck in a problematic state, particularly during code development and when not running in console mode.  Before reporting a runtime bug, please test the code immediately after reboot your system into console mode.  
If the problem persists, then please check the archives of the mailto:swarm-ng@googlegroups.com['Swarm-NG mailing list'] at the http://groups.google.com/group/swarm-ng[Google Group for Swarm-NG] to see if the bug has already been disussed.
If not, then please contact Swarm-NG developers via the mailto:swarm-ng@googlegroups.com['Swarm-NG mailing list'].

== Adding integrators ==

To add a new integrator, follow the following simple steps:

- create a subdirectory integrators/<integrator_name>
- place any source files your integrator requires to that subdirectory
- create a Makefile.mk file there, based on example Makefile.mk files found with
  other integrators (e.g., look at integrators/euler/Makefile.mk)

Your integrator must:

- derive from 'integrator' class, and override one its virtual integrate()
  methods.
- provide an 'extern "C" integrator *create_XXXXX(const config &cfg)'
  function (where XXXX is the name of the integrator) that will return
  an instance of the integrator when called. Example:

        // factory
        extern "C" integrator *create_gpu_euler(const config &cfg)
        {
                return new gpu_euler_integrator(cfg);
        }

== Existing integrators: description and configuration parameters ==

* Hermite
        - h (real number)
                Timestep of the integrator
        - precision (integer)
                1 == double precision, 3 == mixed precision
