== Compiling and running the code ==

To build and run the executable:

	make
	./bin/swarm

or to build and immediately run a test in ./run subdirectory:

	make test

== General layout ==

- swarm.cpp
	Main program file (main() is here)
- swarm.h
	Declarations of ensemble and integrator interfaces
- swarmlib.cpp
	Library of supporting host-only functions for the integrator, ensembles, etc.
- swarmlib.cu
	Library of supporting device functions for the integrators

- swarm.cu
	Autogenerated file (don't edit it by hand!) consisting of include
	statements including swarmlib.cu and all integ.*.cu files from the
	current directory.

== Adding integrators ==

To add a new integrator, follow the following simple steps:

- create a subdirectory integrators/<integrator_name>
- place any source files your integrator requires to that subdirectory
- create a Makefile.mk file there, based on example Makefile.mk files found with
  other integrators (e.g., look at integrators/euler/Makefile.mk)

Your integrator must:

- derive from 'integrator' class, and override one its virtual integrate()
  methods.
- provide an 'extern "C" integrator *create_XXXXX(const config &cfg)'
  function (where XXXX is the name of the integrator) that will return
  an instance of the integrator when called. Example:

	// factory
	extern "C" integrator *create_gpu_euler(const config &cfg)
	{
		return new gpu_euler_integrator(cfg);
	}
