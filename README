README for Swarm-NG
===================
Swarm-NG Development Team
v0.1.01, April 29, 2010: Initial release + 
Swarm-NG v0.1.01 (c) Swarm-NG Development Team 2010

Introduction
------------

.What is Swarm-NG?  

The Swarm-NG package helps scientists and engineers harness the power
of GPUs.  In the early releases, Swarm-NG will focus on the
integration of an ensemble of N-body systems evolving under Newtonian
gravity.  Swarm-NG does not replicate existing libraries that
calculate forces for large-N systems on GPUs, but rather focuses on
integrating an ensemble of many systems where N is small.  This is of
particular interest for astronomers who study the chaotic evolution of
planetary systems.  In the long term, we hope Swarm-NG will allow for
the efficient parallel integration of user-defined systems of ordinary
differential equations.

.What is included in {revdate} release of Swarm-NG {revnumber}?
This initial release contains GPU-based integrators for few-body
systems (hermite_gpu, hermite_cpu, verlet_gpu, verlet_cpu).
It comes with a basic, easy-to-use public interface for setting
initial conditions, calling the GPU-based integration algorithms and
accessing the output data.  Small example programs are provided to
demonstrate functionality and how to program with Swarm-NG.

.Quick Start Tips

* Download the swarm-NG library from http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~eford/code/swarm/download.html

* Build the library and example programs with 'make'.  See <<Building>> 
  for an overview of key points or read link:build_system.html[] for 
  even more info.

* Do a few quick tests with 'make test'.  See <<Testing>> for more info.

* To check the speedup on your system , run 'make benchmark'.  (Warning:
  This requires performing the integrations on both the CPU and GPU,
  so it can take a long time.  Please be patient.)  Report your
  results at http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~eford/code/swarm/submit_benchmark.html[]

* Read some link:http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~eford/code/swarm/docs/[online
  documentation] (text version in docs subdirectory).

* Browse the http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~eford/code/swarm/doxygen/[online reference  manual]. (You can generate a local copy with ''make doc'').

* To see how an end user can use 'swarm' as is:

** Take a look at the test 'test/swarm/swarm-run.test'.  If you ran
   'make test' successfully, then the output will be stored in
   'test-outputs/swarm/swarm-run.test/output.log'

** Read link:swarm.html[] and link:configuration_file.html[] for a
   description of swarm, the configuration file format and valid
   parameters for the 'bin/swarm' program.  (Some of the other demos
   use a configuration file with the same format, but they may not
   accept all the parameters.)

** To see how end users can access data written by the swarm logging
   system, use 'swarmquery output_file'.  For info on options, run
   'swarmquery --help'

* To learn how to access the Swarm-NG library from you own code, work
  through the series of introductory tutorials in src/tutorials (in
  the following order).
. 'src/tutorials/swarm_tutorial_cpu.cpp': uses swarm library with CPU)
. 'src/tutorials/swarm_tutorial_gpu.cpp': uses swarm library with GPU
. 'src/tutorials/swarm_tutorial_compare.cpp': compares results from
GPU & CPU
. 'src/tutorials/swarm_tutorial_benchmark.cpp': compares performance
using GPU & CPU

. 'src/tutorials/swarm_tutorial_montecarlo.cpp': performs many n-body
integrations in Monte Carlo fashion in user-specified region of
parameter space.  This program uses a configuration file.  The format
is described in link:swarm_tutorial_montecarlo.html[].

* To learn more from examples of non-trivial codes, take a look at the following applications:
- 'src/scatter_demo/swarm_scatter_demo.cpp':  example that considers
  the effect of passing stars on planetary system.  More Info at link:swarm_scatter_demo.html[]
- ''src/swarm.cpp': this reads in an ensemble of initial conditions and
  writes output to binary files.  More information at link:swarm.html[]. The output can be easily accessed via the swarmquery program (see link:swarmquery.html[]).

* To learn more about how developers an use the swarm library:

** Read link:for_developers.html[] for an
   overview of how to write your own programs which build on Swarm-NG
   functionality.

** Read link:eventlog.html[] and
   link:snapshotting.html[] for info on using the
   swarm output system.


[[Building]]
Building the Swarm-NG Libraries and Demo Programs
--------------------------------------------------

[[Requirements]]
.What hardware & software is required to build & run Swarm-NG?
* Hardware

** Linux-based workstation (certain kernel versions?)

** nVidia GPU with GT200 chip (we intend to support Fermi in near
   future)  (there are some issues with swarmlog and G80's that may be resolved
   in the future)

* Software

** CUDA v2.3 and/or v3.0 

** g++ v4.3 (CUDA does not yet work with 4.4+)

** Boost++ (known to work with v1.33 and 1.39, but later versions likely to work as well, some header file names changing reported)

** http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/[GNU Science Library (GSL)]

** Asciidoc & Doxygen (if you want to generate html documentation)

** Anything else?

.How do I build Swarm-NG for Linux? 

Run `make`.  Users can specify the paths to compiler, libraries, and
include files, as well as compiler flags in the file
''Makefile.user''.

.How do I build Swarm-NG for Windows? 

While we do not intend to support Swarm-NG for Windows, we can pass
along some of the following tips.

* We're told that following build environments for nvcc work on
  Windows using the The Microsoft Visual Studio compiler, cl, as the
  host compiler:
** Windows DOS shell
** Windows CygWin shells, use nvcc's drive prefix options.
** Windows MinGW shells, use nvcc's drive prefix options.

* Although a variety of POSIX style shells is supported on Windows,
  nvcc will still assume the Microsoft Visual Studio compiler for host
  compilation. Use of gcc is not supported on Windows.

* You can find more information from `/usr/local/cuda/doc/nvcc_3.0.pdf`

[[Testing]]
.How do I test Swarm-NG? 

`make test` + 

In the current release, small differences in floating point values can
result in 'failures' that are inconsequential.  So if the failures
occur, please take a look at the output file indicated to check
whether the difference is significant.

If so and you can not solve the problem, then run 'make feedback',
which will generate a file named 'feedback.tgz' which we may request
that you send the developers.


Demo Programs 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Commands to run demo codes
First, build the tutorials and demos with `make`.  Then, you can run
the following demos from the tutorial.

- swarm_tutorial_cpu:  run `bin/swarm_tutorial_cpu`

- swarm_tutorial_gpu:  run `bin/swarm_tutorial_gpu`

- swarm_tutorial_compare:  run `bin/swarm_tutorial_compare`

- swarm_tutorial_benchmark: run `bin/swarm_tutorial_benchmark`.
  Several options are avaliable.  run with the command line option
  --help for more info.

- swarm_tutorial_montecarlo: change into the run sub-directory and run
`../bin/swarm_tutorial_montecarlo integrator-tutorial_montecarlo.cfg`
The behavior of this tutorial can be easily adjusted by changing the
configuration file.  See link:swarm_tutorial_montecarlo.html[] 
for details.

- swarm_scatter_demo: This requires multiple input files.  See
  link:swarm_scatter_demo.html[] for
  details.


Known Limitations and/or Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- swarm is limited to N-body systems with 3-10 bodies.
- swarm only integrates forward in time.
- While there are euler, rk4 and rkck integrators, they are in a preliminary
  form and should not be used.
- E.g., rk4 requires exactly 3 bodies and does not include a cpu version
- For an updated list, visit the
  http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~eford/code/swarm/[Swarm-NG Website]

.What should I do if I think I found a compile-time bug?

- Please first check that you can successfully run `make test`.  If
  this fails, then please double check that you have the required
  drivers, libraries installed and paths set correctly.  You may need
  to create a Makefile.user to specify the path to your compilers,
  libraries, include files.  You may also need to specify the path to
  your cuda libraries via LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

- If the error arises while compiling the included tests, then run
  'make feedback', which will generate a file named 'feedback.tgz'
  which we may request that you send us.

- Otherwise, please identify the minimal amount of code that produces
  the compiler error.

- Contact Swarm-NG developers via the
  mailto:swarm-ng@googlegroups.com['Swarm-NG mailing list']

.What should I do if I think I found a run-time bug?

Unfortunately, GPUs can sometime get stuck in a problematic state,
particularly during code development and when not running in console
mode.  Before reporting a runtime bug, _please test the code
immediately after reboot your system into console mode_.

If the problem persists, then please check the archives of the
mailto:swarm-ng@googlegroups.com['Swarm-NG mailing list'] at the
http://groups.google.com/group/swarm-ng[Google Group for Swarm-NG] to
see if the bug has already been discussed.

If not, then please contact Swarm-NG developers via the
mailto:swarm-ng@googlegroups.com['Swarm-NG mailing list'].
