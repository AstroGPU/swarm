 \brief Swarm-NG is a collection of code which to help
scientists and engineers harness the power of GPUs.  In the early
releases, Swarm-NG will focus on the integration of an ensemble of
N-body systems evolving under Newtonian gravity.  There are existing
libraries to perform the force calculation for large-N systems on
GPUs.  Swarm-NG does not replicate these, but rather focuses on
integrating an ensemble of many systems where N is small.  This is of
partiular interest for astronomers who study the chaotic evolution of
planetary systems.  In the long term, we hope Swarm-NG will allow for
the efficient parallel integration of user-defined systems of ordinary
differential equations.
