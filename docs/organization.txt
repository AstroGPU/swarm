Swarm-NG v0.1 (c) Swarm-NG Development Team 2010

Main Swarm Directories
----------------------

Upon untaring swarm-current.tgz, Swarm-NG there should be the
directories the *swarm* directory:

-----------------------
docs               <1>
integrators        <2>
   euler  
   hermite_adap_gpu  
   hermite_cpu  
   hermite_gpu  
   mvs  
   rk4  
   verlet  
   verlet_cpu
run                <3>
scripts            <4>
src                <5>
   cux
   gpulog
   scatter_demo
   tutorials
test               <6>
   swarm
   swarm_scatter_demo
   tutorial_compare
   tutorial_cpu
   tutorial_gpu
   tutorial_montecarlo
-----------------------

<1> <<anchor-docs,docs>> contains documentation for library and demo progarms (''make doc-asciidoc'' generates html version of this documentation)
<2> <<anchor-integrators,integrators>> each subdirectory contains the code for a single integrator (e.g., hermite_gpu, hermite_cpu, ...).  The first release contains a few working integrators, (e.g., hermite_gpu and hermite_cpu) and a few that are still in development (e.g., hermite_adap_gpu, rk4, euler).
<3> <<anchor-run,run>> is where swarm is intended to be run from. It also contains example configuration files.
<4> <<anchor-scripts,scripts>> contains scripts used by the build process.  
<5> <<anchor-src,src>> contains the source code for teh swarm library, as well as demonstration programs (e.g., 'tutorials/*.cpp', 'scatter_demo/swarm_scatter_demo.cpp')
<6> <<anchor-test,test>> contains scripts and data files to test your installation of the swarm libaray and demo programs.

The following directories can be generated via the build system:

---------------------
bin               <1> 
reference         <2>
   html
   latex
   xml
test-outputs      <3>
   swarm
   swarm_scatter_demo
   tutorial_compare
   tutorial_cpu
   tutorial_gpu
   tutorial_montecarlo
----------------------
<1> <<anchor-bin,bin>> contains executables (generated by ''make'')
<2> <<anchor-reference,reference>> contains reference manual (generated by ''make doc-doxygen'' or ''make doc'')
<3> <<anchor-test-outputs,test-outputs>> contains results of tests (generated by ''make test'')

Other files in the main directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The main directory should also contain the files:

* .gitignore:    Files of files git version control system should not track
* Doxyfile:      Configuration files for doxygen to generate reference manual
* Makefile:      Makefile for build system
* README.txt:    Overview of documentation
* swarm.kdevelop: for developers using kdevelop
* swarm.kdevelop.filelist: for developers using kdevelop


[[anchor-docs]]
Organization of documentation (docs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the README in the root directory, there are
several text files (ending in .txt or .man) in the *docs*
subdirectory. +

If you have asciidoc installed, then you can generate pretty html (or
other formats) with 'make doc-asciidoc'.  An online version of the
most recent documentation for the current version is
avaliable http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~eford/code/swarm/docs/[online]. + 

While documenting source code is an ongoing projet, there is
significant inline documentation.  If you have doxygen installed, then
you can generate pretty html by running 'make doc-doxygen'. It places
output in the *reference* subdirectory.  An online version for the 
current version of swarm is avaliable
http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~eford/code/swarm/doxygen/[here].+  


Organization of executables (bin and run)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[anchor-bin]]
All swarm executables and the swarm library (libswarm.so) are placed in
the *bin* directory. + 

[[anchor-run]]
The *run* directory contains configuration files and is where swarm is
intended to be run from.

Organization of source code (src and integrators)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[anchor-src]]
The main source code is in the *src* directory. +

[[anchor-integrators]]
Source code for the various integrators is in subdirectories of
*src/integrators*. +

Source code for the tutorials is in the *src/tutorials* directory. + 

Source code for the swarm_scatter_demo is in the *src/scatter_demo*
directory. +

Source code for the GPU logging system is in the *src/gpulog* directory. +
Various utilities are in *src/cux* and *src/astro*. +

Organization of test directories (test, test-outputs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[anchor-test]]

The *test* directory contains several subdirectoires.  ''make test''
results in running the file named .test in that subdirectory to
perform a test.  Typically, the results are compared to a reference
file named output.ref.

[[anchor-test-outputs]]

When running ''make test'' the output of each test is stored in a
subdirectory of test-outputs (with the same name as the subdirectory
of test).  A file ending in ".log" contains the difference between
your results and the results of a referene run (provided or can be
recreated by ''make test-create'').  The full output is stored in a
sub-subdirecory.

Other directories (scripts, etc)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[anchor-scripts]]
The *scripts* directory has scripts needed for the build system, as
well as for generating initial conditions for some demo programs.  +

[[anchor-reference]]

link:organization.html[] and/or the
link:../reference/html/files.html[doxygen files page].
