/*! \defgroup integrators Integrators
 *  Integrators are used to do the ODE (Ordinary Differential Equations) integration  
 *  Swarm-NG includes several integrators that build on the common data structures and 
 *  and work models. This framework makes it easy for a developer to implement a new
 *  integrator that takes advantage of the highly parallel GPU architecture with minimal
 *  attention to hardware details.

/*! \defgroup propagators Propagators
 *  A “propagator” class implements a device function that advance one system by one 
 *  time step for one system. It can be readily combined with the generic_integrator
 *  to quickly provide a new GPU-based integration algorithm. 
 */

/*! \defgroup monitors Monitors
 *  A “monitor” class is responsible for determining when the system state should be 
 *  logged and when the GPU should cease integrating a given system. If the monitor 
 *  determines that logging is needed, then the system’s current state is written to 
 *  a buffer in the GPU global device memory
