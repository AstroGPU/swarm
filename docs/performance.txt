Performance of Swarm-NG 
=======================
Eric Ford

The executable swarm_tutorial_benchmark can be used to evaluate the performance of swarm for your CPU and GPU.  For details about what benchmark is used and options, see link:swarm_tutorial_benchmark.html.  

Note that the default values are choosen so that it doesn't take too long.
To get good performance on a GPU requires a large number of systems.
maximum GPU performance requires integrating thousands of systems in parallel (e.g., 7680 or 15360 on G92-based GPUs and 8096 or 16384 for G80-based GPUs).


Performance Results
-------------------

We encourage users to report their performance results via http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~eford/code/swarm/[this form], after which it is automatically entered in a public spreadsheet (link to spreadsheet from form).
