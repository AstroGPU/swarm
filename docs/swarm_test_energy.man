swarm_test_energy(1)
====================

NAME
---- 
swarm_test_energy - Program for computing change in energy during integration
from binary files generated by swarm GPU logging subsystem.

SYMPOSIS
--------
*swarm_test_energy*  DATAFILE 
This is a useful tool for checking that an ensemble of integrations conserved enegy to an acceptible level.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The program reads a binary output file generated by the swarm GPU
logging subsystem.  It computes the total energy (kinetic plus
potential assuming Newtonian gravity) at the beginning and end of each
integration.  It outputs information about the two systems with the
worst energy conservation and the two that ended first (in simulation
time).

This program also demonstrates how to read in a binary output file
generated by the GPU logging subsystem.

EXAMPLE
-------
Assuming that you have already generated a binary output file from the
swarm loggin system that is named log.bin, you would run: +
''../bin/swarm_test_energy log.bin''

OUTPUT
------
swarm_test_energy outputs a text version of the initial conditions and
the final conditions for the first two systems in the ensemble.  Then
it outputs the final conditions of the two systems with the worst
energy conservation, followed by the final conditions of the two
systems that ended the earliest (in simulation time).

Each line of output contains: + 
SystemId BodyId Time Mass x y z vy vy vz Energy dE/E +
with additional text for clarity, like
''    0     0  T=1.000000  m=1.000000  pos=(  0.00001  -0.00000   0.00000)  vel=(  0.00002  -0.00000   0.00001)  E=-1.39204e-05  dE/E=3.71175e-14''


LIMITATIONS & BUGS
------------------
The program can be easily modified to print information about more
systems (line 61).
