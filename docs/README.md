This directory contains documentation for swarm.
Most documentation is easily accessed via the webpages generated by doxygen. 
You can build the documentation for your local version of swarm using "make doc".
Or you can browse the documentation for the last release http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~eford/code/swarm/doxygen/[on line].

TODO:  Several documentation files need to be updated for Swarm-NG v1.
