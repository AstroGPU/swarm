# Swarm-NG: Discovery of Extrasolar planetary systems on CUDA
The Swarm-NG package helps scientists and engineers harness the power
of GPUs.  In the early releases, Swarm-NG will focus on the
integration of an ensemble of N-body systems evolving under Newtonian
gravity.  Swarm-NG does not replicate existing libraries that
calculate forces for large-N systems on GPUs, but rather focuses on
integrating an ensemble of many systems where N is small.  This is of
particular interest for astronomers who study the chaotic evolution of
planetary systems.  In the long term, we hope Swarm-NG will allow for
the efficient parallel integration of user-defined systems of ordinary
differential equations.
