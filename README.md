# Swarm-NG: A CUDA Library for Parallel n-body Integrations with focus on Simulations
of Planetary Systems
The Swarm-NG package helps scientists and engineers harness the power
of GPUs for high throughput integration of n-body systems.  Swarm-NG focuses 
on the integration of an ensemble of N-body systems evolving under Newtonian
gravity.  Swarm-NG does not replicate existing libraries that
calculate forces for large-N systems on GPUs, but rather focuses on
integrating an ensemble of many systems where N is small.  This is of
particular interest for astronomers who study the chaotic evolution of
planetary systems.
